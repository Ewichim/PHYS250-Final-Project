# simulations for smart pixels

# Introduction
'''
Ok, I've spent way too long messing with the setup of this document to tell you that its just not worth it... So i've deleted all of the original link and provided ome brief detail for where to find eveything:

There are only 3 files which I have written myself completely:

EricTesting.ipynb (Testing and Graphing Hadron Simulations)
MuonTest.ipynb (Testing and Graphing Muon Simulations)
MuonFilter .ipynb (Testing and Graphing Muon Simulations with filtering)

there are also files I modified:

launch.py (Create Hadron Tracks)
launchewic.py (Create Hadron Tracks but with differeing GEV Values)
yprofile.ipynb (Find y-profiles and read parquet files)
yprofileMuC.ipynb (Find y-profiles and read parquet files for muon colliders)

These won't work, but hopefully the graphs are there for you to look at
